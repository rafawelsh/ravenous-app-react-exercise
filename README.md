## Codecademy Exercise

This project is part of the 10th module of Codecademy's Web Developement Path. This app is a Yelp clone.

### `1. Static Site`

The first part of this project was initialize a new React app and create multiple components to create a static site. <br>

<ul>
    <li>Business</li>
    <li>BusinessList</li>
    <li>SearchBar</li>
</ul>


### `2. Props`

Added props to the code to reduce the amount of instancesof Businesses. Now the app can render as many business as are inputted into the code. Still static at this point.


### `3. State`

Added state to the SearchBar component. This allowed the app to pass information when the user selects a filter option.
